                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>1. Clients, Mods, Resource Packs
<br></strong>
<br>
<br>Modifications and resource packs which give the player a significant gameplay advantage over other players are not allowed unless approved by an admin. This applies to all clients, mods, and resource packs. A list of approved mods can be found<em><strong> <a href="allowed-mods.html" class="text-black">here</a></strong></em><br>
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>2. Chat
</strong><br>
<br>We ask that players keep global chat English and to keep other languages in private messages. However, short sayings such as greetings or well-known statements are acceptable once in a while. Doxxing or sharing any personal information or identities of others without their explicit permission is strictly forbidden.
<br>
<br>All rules in this section apply to nicknames, player names, warp names, builds, and signs. Evading a mute or chat related ban though the use of Discord or alternate accounts is not allowed.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>A – </strong>Spam is not allowed. Messages which are similar to each other must be sent at least 5 minutes apart. Gibberish, unnecessarily repeating characters, unnecessarily spacing characters in a word, or unnecessarily capitalizing letters is considered spam.
<br>
<br><strong>B –</strong> Mass advertising another Minecraft server or websites relating to other Minecraft servers in the global chat or in DMs is not allowed.
<br>
<br><strong>C –</strong> Do not talk about sensitive topics in chat, i.e., religion, politics, abuse, self-harm, and topics unsuitable for younger players. Adult suited topics are allowed in global chat only between the times 12am and 6am EST.
<br>Discussing self-harm or other deeply negative experiences is never allowed. Taco Haven is not the place to discuss this. If you or someone you know needs confidential support for depression, self-harm, or suicidal thoughts, please contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline by calling 1-800-273-8255.
<br>
<br><strong>D –</strong> Swearing on Taco Haven is allowed but cannot be directed at another player.
<br>
<br><strong>E –</strong> Impersonating others is not allowed.
<br>
<strong><br>F –</strong> Bullying, harassment, hate speech, and name-calling are not allowed.
<br>
<br><strong>G –</strong> Leading or encouraging violence or hatred towards other players is not allowed.
<br>
<br><strong>H –</strong> Do not accuse other players of hacking in global chat.
<br>
<br><strong>3. Exploits
</strong><br>
<br>Taking advantage of any server bugs or otherwise exploiting technical oversights is not allowed. You may not attempt to duplicate items or entities, exit the world border, or use alternate accounts for the purpose of evading shopbans, selling to the server shop or on the Auction House.
<br>
<br><strong>4. Lag, Grief, &amp; Player Killing
</strong><br>
<br>Pranking through grief, theft, player traps, or other means is allowed only if the other player gives you explicit permission saying that you can prank them and how you can prank them. There are designated PVP arenas around the map including /warp PVP.
<br>
<br><strong>A –</strong> Causing harm to our services through means such as DOS, DDOS are not allowed.
<br>
<br><strong>B –</strong> Lagging our server through means such as lag machines is not allowed.
<br>
<br><strong>C –</strong> Any mob grinder using mob spawners that are affected by light must have a shut off switch to prevent high mob counts and lag.
<br>
<br><strong>D – </strong>Stealing from and raiding other players is not allowed, even if the land is unclaimed or appears abandoned. Do not raid structures that a player has built near.
<br>
<br><strong>E&nbsp;–</strong> Scamming is not allowed whatsoever. All involved parties must know and follow the terms of any agreement.
<br>
<br><strong>F – </strong>You may not harm, kill, or trap another player by any means, unless in an admin approved PvP arena.
<br>
<br><strong>G –</strong> Do not force another player into PvP.
<br>
<br><strong>H –</strong> Do not force another player to equip cursed items.
<br>
<br><strong>5. Build Rules
</strong><br>
<br>In all survival worlds, your build must be at least 100 blocks away (Chebyshev distance) from the closest build.
<br>If you expand into someone else's radius, you must either work it out with the other player or come to staff for help mediating.
<br>If you don't see any builds nearby and you believe you are 100 blocks away from the nearest build, you are allowed to build there.
<br>In the creative world, your build must be at least 16 blocks away (Chebyshev distance) from the closest build.
<br>
<br><strong>A –</strong> Claim blocking, which is the act of deliberately placing claims near someone else's build to block its expansion, is not allowed. This includes placing a new town next to another with the intent of blocking their expansion.
<br>
<br><strong>B – </strong>Town and claim owners are allowed to kick any players off of their property for any reason and duration, even if the removed player has claim trust or currently dwells on said property.
<br>
<br><strong>Use common sense. If a staff member says something, then treat it as a rule. If a staff member instructs you to end a conversation, you must end it regardless of how controversial. <br></strong><em>(Rules are subject to change its best to check back from time to time)</em></p>
